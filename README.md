## Algorithms and Datastructures

A repo for showing off cool and neat datastructures and algorithms. 
Either for the purpose of getting better at interviewing or just to learn more.

This repo will contain detailed examples of implementations, as well as reasons for what makes a particular algorithm better than another, or the advantages/disadvantages of different approaches.

I plan for this repo to become a resource for learning about algorthims and datastructures in a particle but also fun way. 

I want anyone to be able to contribute and add more interesting algorithms/data structures as the repo grows.
If you're interested in contributing, read the steps outlined [here](#contributing).
